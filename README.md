# BBC_Location_ID_Weather_Scraping

## A code which helps to scrape the location ID of any city in BBC

This code snippet takes city name as input and it hits the BBC Weahter API with a request for location ID. 

This location ID is used as input in the next part of the code to scrape weather forecast for the city using this location ID.

Web scraping might not be legal always. 

It is a good idea to check the terms of the website you plan to scrape before proceeding.

Also, if your code requests a url from a server multiple times, it is a good practice to either cache your requests, or insert a timed delay between consecutive requests.
